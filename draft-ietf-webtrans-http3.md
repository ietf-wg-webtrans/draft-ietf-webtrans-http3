--- abstract

WebTransport {{!OVERVIEW=I-D.ietf-webtrans-overview}} is a protocol framework
that enables clients constrained by the Web security model to communicate with
a remote server using a secure multiplexed transport.  This document describes
a WebTransport protocol that is based on HTTP/3 {{!HTTP3=RFC9114}} and provides
support for unidirectional streams, bidirectional streams and datagrams, all
multiplexed within the same HTTP/3 connection.

# Introduction

HTTP/3 [HTTP3] is a protocol defined on top of QUIC {{!RFC9000}} that can
multiplex HTTP requests over a QUIC connection.  This document defines a
mechanism for multiplexing non-HTTP data with HTTP/3 in a manner that conforms
with the WebTransport protocol requirements and semantics[OVERVIEW].  Using the
mechanism described here, multiple WebTransport instances can be multiplexed
simultaneously with regular HTTP traffic on the same HTTP/3 connection.

## Terminology

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

This document follows terminology defined in Section 1.2 of [OVERVIEW].  Note
that this document distinguishes between a WebTransport server and an HTTP/3
server.  An HTTP/3 server is the server that terminates HTTP/3 connections; a
WebTransport server is an application that accepts WebTransport sessions, which
can be accessed via an HTTP/3 server.

# Protocol Overview

WebTransport servers in general are identified by a pair of authority value and
path value (defined in {{!RFC3986}} Sections 3.2 and 3.3 correspondingly).

When an HTTP/3 connection is established, both the client and server have to
send a SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBTRANSPORT setting in order to indicate that they both
support WebTransport over HTTP/3.

WebTransport sessions are initiated inside a given HTTP/3 connection by the
client, who sends an extended CONNECT request {{!RFC8441}}.  If the server
accepts the request, a WebTransport session is established.  The resulting
stream will be further referred to as a *CONNECT stream*, and its stream ID is
used to uniquely identify a given WebTransport session within the connection.
The ID of the CONNECT stream that established a given WebTransport session will
be further referred to as a *Session ID*.

After the session is established, the peers can exchange data using the
following mechanisms:

* A client can create a bidirectional stream using a special indefinite-length
  HTTP/3 frame that transfers ownership of the stream to WebTransport.
* A server can create a bidirectional stream, which is possible since HTTP/3
  does not define any semantics for server-initiated bidirectional streams.
* Both client and server can create a unidirectional stream using a special
  stream type.
* A datagram can be sent using HTTP Datagrams {{!HTTP-DATAGRAM=RFC9297}}.

A WebTransport session is terminated when the CONNECT stream that created it is
closed.

# Session Establishment

## Establishing a Transport-Capable HTTP/3 Connection

In order to indicate support for WebTransport, both the client and the server
MUST send a SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBTRANSPORT value set to "1" in their SETTINGS
frame.  The SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBTRANSPORT parameter value SHALL be either "0" or
"1", with "0" being the default; an endpoint that receives a value other than
"0" or "1" MUST close the connection with the H3_SETTINGS_ERROR error code.

The client MUST NOT send a WebTransport request until it has received the
setting indicating WebTransport support from the server.  Similarly, the server
MUST NOT process any incoming WebTransport requests until the client settings
have been received, as the client may be using a version of WebTransport
extension that is different from the one used by the server.

In addition to the setting above, the server MUST send a
SETTINGS_MAX_WEBTRANSPORT_SESSIONS parameter indicating the maximum number of
concurrent sessions it is willing to receive.  The default value for the
SETTINGS_MAX_WEBTRANSPORT_SESSIONS parameter is "0", meaning that the server is
not willing to receive any WebTransport sessions.

## Extended CONNECT in HTTP/3

{{!RFC8441}} defines an extended CONNECT method in Section 4, enabled by the
SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL setting.  That setting is defined for HTTP/3
by {{!RFC9220}}.  An endpoint supporting WebTransport over HTTP/3 MUST send
both the SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBTRANSPORT setting and the
SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL setting with values set to "1".

## Creating a New Session

As WebTransport sessions are established over HTTP/3, they are identified using
the `https` URI scheme ([HTTP], Section 4.2.2).

In order to create a new WebTransport session, a client can send an HTTP CONNECT
request.  The `:protocol` pseudo-header field ({{!RFC8441}}) MUST be set to
`webtransport`.  The `:scheme` field MUST be `https`.  Both the `:authority`
and the `:path` value MUST be set; those fields indicate the desired
WebTransport server.  If the WebTransport session is coming from a browser
client, an `Origin` header {{!RFC6454}} MUST be provided within the request;
otherwise, the header is OPTIONAL.

Upon receiving an extended CONNECT request with a `:protocol` field set to
`webtransport`, the HTTP/3 server can check if it has a WebTransport server
associated with the specified `:authority` and `:path` values.  If it does not,
it SHOULD reply with status code 404 ({{Section 15.5.5 of !HTTP=RFC9110}}).
When the request contains the `Origin` header, the WebTransport server MUST
verify the `Origin` header to ensure that the specified origin is allowed to
access the server in question. If the verification fails, the WebTransport
server SHOULD reply with status code 403 ({{Section 15.5.4 of HTTP}}).  If all
checks pass, the WebTransport server MAY accept the session by replying with a
2xx series status code, as defined in {{Section 15.3 of HTTP}}.

From the client's perspective, a WebTransport session is established when the
client receives a 2xx response.  From the server's perspective, a session is
established once it sends a 2xx response.

Clients cannot initiate WebTransport in 0-RTT packets, as the CONNECT method is
not considered safe; see {{Section 10.9 of HTTP3}}. However,
WebTransport-related SETTINGS parameters may be retained from the previous
session as described in Section 7.2.4.2 of [HTTP3].  If the server accepts
0-RTT, the server MUST NOT reduce the limit of maximum open WebTransport
sessions from the one negotiated during the previous session; such change would
be deemed incompatible, and MUST result in a H3_SETTINGS_ERROR connection
error.

The `webtransport` HTTP Upgrade Token uses the Capsule Protocol as defined in
{{HTTP-DATAGRAM}}.

## Limiting the Number of Simultaneous Sessions

This document defines a SETTINGS_MAX_WEBTRANSPORT_SESSIONS parameter that allows
the server to limit the maximum number of concurrent WebTransport sessions on a
single HTTP/3 connection.  The client MUST NOT open more sessions than
indicated in the server SETTINGS parameters.  The server MUST NOT close the
connection if the client opens sessions exceeding this limit, as the client and
the server do not have a consistent view of how many sessions are open due to
the asynchronous nature of the protocol; instead, it MUST reset all of the
CONNECT streams it is not willing to process with the `HTTP_REQUEST_REJECTED`
status defined in [HTTP3].

Just like other HTTP requests, WebTransport sessions, and data sent on those
sessions, are counted against flow control limits.  This document does not
introduce additional mechanisms for endpoints to limit the relative amount of
flow control credit consumed by different WebTransport sessions, however
servers that wish to limit the rate of incoming requests on any particular
session have alternative mechanisms:

* The `HTTP_REQUEST_REJECTED` error code defined in [HTTP3] indicates to the
  receiving HTTP/3 stack that the request was not processed in any way.
* HTTP status code 429 indicates that the request was rejected due to rate
  limiting {{!RFC6585}}.  Unlike the previous method, this signal is directly
  propagated to the application.

# WebTransport Features

WebTransport over HTTP/3 provides the following features described in
[OVERVIEW]: unidirectional streams, bidirectional streams and datagrams,
initiated by either endpoint.

Session IDs are used to demultiplex streams and datagrams belonging to different
WebTransport sessions.  On the wire, session IDs are encoded using the QUIC
variable length integer scheme described in {{!RFC9000}}.

The client MAY optimistically open unidirectional and bidirectional streams, as
well as send datagrams, for a session that it has sent the CONNECT request for,
even if it has not yet received the server's response to the request. On the
server side, opening streams and sending datagrams is possible as soon as the
CONNECT request has been received.

If at any point a session ID is received that cannot a valid ID for a
client-initiated bidirectional stream, the recipient MUST close the connection
with an H3_ID_ERROR error code.

## Unidirectional streams

WebTransport endpoints can initiate unidirectional streams.  The HTTP/3
unidirectional stream type SHALL be 0x54.  The body of the stream SHALL be the stream
type, followed by the session ID, encoded as a variable-length integer, followed
by the user-specified stream data ({{fig-unidi}}).

{: #fig-unidi title="Unidirectional WebTransport stream format"}

## Bidirectional Streams

WebTransport endpoints can initiate bidirectional streams by opening an HTTP/3
bidirectional stream and then immediately sending a special signal value 0x41,
followed by the associated session ID, both encoded as a variable-length
integer; the rest of the stream is the application payload of the WebTransport
stream ({{fig-bidi-client}}).

{: #fig-bidi-client title="Bidirectional WebTransport stream header"}

This document registers the special signal value 0x41 as a WEBTRANSPORT_STREAM
frame type.  While it is registered as an HTTP/3 frame type to avoid
collisions, WEBTRANSPORT_STREAM is not a proper HTTP/3 frame, as it lacks
length; it is an extension of HTTP/3 frame syntax that MUST be supported by any
peer negotiating `SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBTRANSPORT`.  Any attempt to use
WEBTRANSPORT_STREAM as a frame type outside of the very first byte of the
stream MUST be treated as a connection error of type H3_FRAME_ERROR.

HTTP/3 does not by itself define any semantics for server-initiated
bidirectional streams.  If WebTransport setting is negotiated by both
endpoints, the syntax of the server-initiated bidirectional streams SHALL be
the same as the syntax of client-initiated bidirectional streams, that is, a
sequence of HTTP/3 frames.  The only frame defined by this document for use
within server-initiated bidirectional streams is WEBTRANSPORT_STREAM.

TODO: move the paragraph above into a separate draft; define what happens with
already existing HTTP/3 frames on server-initiated bidirectional streams.

## Resetting Data Streams

A WebTransport endpoint may send a RESET_STREAM or a STOP_SENDING frame for a
WebTransport data stream.  Those signals are propagated by the WebTransport
implementation to the application.

A WebTransport application SHALL provide an error code for those operations.
Since WebTransport shares the error code space with HTTP/3, WebTransport
application errors for streams are limited to an unsigned 8-bit integer,
assuming values between 0x00 and 0xff.  WebTransport implementations SHALL
remap those error codes into an error range where 0x00 corresponds to
0x52e4a40fa8db, and 0xff corresponds to 0x52e4a40fa9e2.  Note that there are
code points inside that range of form "0x1f * N + 0x21" that are reserved by
{{Section 8.1 of HTTP3}}; those have to be accounted for when mapping the error
codes by skipping them (i.e. the two HTTP/3 error codepoints adjacent to a
GREASE codepoint would map to two adjacent WebTransport application error
codepoints).  An example pseudocode can be seen in
{{fig-remap-errors}}.

~~~~~~~~~~
    first = 0x52e4a40fa8db
    last = 0x52e4a40fa9e2

    def webtransport_code_to_http_code(n):
        return first + n + floor(n / 0x1e)

    def http_code_to_webtransport_code(h):
        assert(first <= h <= last)
        assert((h - 0x21) % 0x1f != 0)
        shifted = h - first
        return shifted - shifted // 0x1f
~~~~~~~~~~
{: #fig-remap-errors title="Pseudocode for converting between WebTransport
application errors and HTTP/3 error codes; here, `//` is integer division" }

WebTransport data streams are associated with sessions through a header at the
beginning of the stream; resetting a stream may result in that data being
discarded.  Because of that, WebTransport application error codes are best
effort, as the WebTransport stack is not always capable of associating the
reset code with a session.  The only exception is the situation where there is
only one session on a given HTTP/3 connection, and no intermediaries between
the client and the server.

WebTransport implementations SHALL forward the error code for a stream
associated with a known session to the application that owns that session;
similarly, the intermediaries SHALL reset the streams with corresponding error
code when receiving a reset from the peer.  If a WebTransport implementation
intentionally allows only one session over a given HTTP/3 connection, it SHALL
forward the error codes within WebTransport application error code range to the
application that owns the only session on that connection.

## Datagrams

Datagrams can be sent using HTTP Datagrams. The WebTransport datagram payload is
sent unmodified in the "HTTP Datagram Payload" field of an HTTP Datagram.

## Buffering Incoming Streams and Datagrams

In WebTransport over HTTP/3, the client MAY send its SETTINGS frame, as well as
multiple WebTransport CONNECT requests, WebTransport data streams and
WebTransport datagrams, all within a single flight.  As those can arrive out of
order, a WebTransport server could be put into a situation where it receives a
stream or a datagram without a corresponding session.  Similarly, a client may
receive a server-initiated stream or a datagram before receiving the CONNECT
response headers from the server.

To handle this case, WebTransport endpoints SHOULD buffer streams and datagrams
until those can be associated with an established session.  To avoid resource
exhaustion, the endpoints MUST limit the number of buffered streams and
datagrams.  When the number of buffered streams is exceeded, a stream SHALL be
closed by sending a RESET_STREAM and/or STOP_SENDING with the
`H3_WEBTRANSPORT_BUFFERED_STREAM_REJECTED` error code.  When the number of
buffered datagrams is exceeded, a datagram SHALL be dropped.  It is up to an
implementation to choose what stream or datagram to discard.

## Interaction with HTTP/3 GOAWAY frame

HTTP/3 defines a graceful shutdown mechanism (Section 5.2 of [HTTP3]) that
allows a peer to send a GOAWAY frame indicating that it will no longer accept
any new incoming requests or pushes.  This mechanism applies to the CONNECT
requests for new WebTransport sessions.  A GOAWAY frame does not affect data
streams for existing WebTransport sessions; those can continue to be opened
even after the GOAWAY frame has been sent or received.

To drain a WebTransport session, either endpoint can send a
DRAIN_WEBTRANSPORT_SESSION capsule.  After sending or receiving a
DRAIN_WEBTRANSPORT_SESSION capsule, an endpoint MAY continue using the session
but SHOULD attempt to gracefully terminate the session as soon as possible.

~~~
DRAIN_WEBTRANSPORT_SESSION Capsule {
  Type (i) = DRAIN_WEBTRANSPORT_SESSION,
  Length (i) = 0
}
~~~

# Session Termination

A WebTransport session over HTTP/3 is considered terminated when either of the
following conditions is met:

* the CONNECT stream is closed, either cleanly or abruptly, on either side; or
* a CLOSE_WEBTRANSPORT_SESSION capsule is either sent or received.

Upon learning that the session has been terminated, the endpoint MUST reset the
send side and abort reading on the receive side of all of the streams
associated with the session (see Section 2.4 of {{!RFC9000}}) using the
H3_WEBTRANSPORT_SESSION_GONE error code; it MUST NOT send any new datagrams or
open any new streams.

To terminate a session with a detailed error message, an application MAY send
an HTTP capsule {{HTTP-DATAGRAM}} of type CLOSE_WEBTRANSPORT_SESSION (0x2843).
The format of the capsule SHALL be as follows:

~~~
CLOSE_WEBTRANSPORT_SESSION Capsule {
  Type (i) = CLOSE_WEBTRANSPORT_SESSION,
  Length (i),
  Application Error Code (32),
  Application Error Message (..8192),
}
~~~

CLOSE_WEBTRANSPORT_SESSION has the following fields:

Application Error Code:

: A 32-bit error code provided by the application closing the connection.

Application Error Message:

: A UTF-8 encoded error message string provided by the application closing the
  connection.  The message takes up the remainder of the capsule, and its
  length MUST NOT exceed 1024 bytes.

An endpoint that sends a CLOSE_WEBTRANSPORT_SESSION capsule MUST immediately
send a FIN.  The endpoint MAY send a STOP_SENDING to indicate it is no longer
reading from the CONNECT stream.  The recipient MUST close the stream upon
receiving a FIN.  If any additional stream data is received on the CONNECT
stream after receiving a CLOSE_WEBTRANSPORT_SESSION capsule, the stream MUST be
reset with code H3_MESSAGE_ERROR.

Cleanly terminating a CONNECT stream without a CLOSE_WEBTRANSPORT_SESSION
capsule SHALL be semantically equivalent to terminating it with a
CLOSE_WEBTRANSPORT_SESSION capsule that has an error code of 0 and an empty
error string.

In some scenarios, an endpoint might want to send a CLOSE_WEBTRANSPORT_SESSION
with detailed close information and then immediately close the underlying QUIC
connection.  If the endpoint were to do both of those simultaneously, the peer
could potentially receive the CONNECTION_CLOSE before receiving the
CLOSE_WEBTRANSPORT_SESSION, thus never receiving the application error data
contained in the latter.  To avoid this, the endpoint SHOULD wait until all of
the data on the CONNECT stream is acknowledged before sending the
CONNECTION_CLOSE; this gives CLOSE_WEBTRANSPORT_SESSION properties similar to
that of the QUIC CONNECTION_CLOSE mechanism as a best-effort mechanism of
delivering application close metadata.

# Negotiating the Draft Version

\[\[RFC editor: please remove this section before publication.]]

WebTransport over HTTP/3 uses two different mechanisms to negotiate versions for
the different parts of the draft.

The hop-by-hop wire format aspects of the protocol are negotiated by changing
the codepoint used for the SETTINGS_ENABLE_WEBTRANSPORT parameter.  Because of
that, any WebTransport endpoint MUST wait for the peer's SETTINGS frame before
sending or processing any WebTransport traffic.  When multiple versions are
supported by both of the peers, the most recent version supported by both is
selected.

The data exchanged over the CONNECT stream is transmitted across intermediaries,
and thus cannot be versioned using a SETTINGS parameter.  To indicate support
for different versions of the protocol defined in this draft, the clients SHALL
send a header for each version of the draft supported.  The header
corresponding to the version described in this draft is
`Sec-Webtransport-Http3-Draft02`; its value SHALL be `1`.  The server SHALL
reply with a `Sec-Webtransport-Http3-Draft` header indicating the selected
version; its value SHALL be `draft02` for the version described in this draft.

# Security Considerations

WebTransport over HTTP/3 satisfies all of the security requirements imposed by
[OVERVIEW] on WebTransport protocols, thus providing a secure framework for
client-server communication in cases when the client is potentially untrusted.

WebTransport over HTTP/3 requires explicit opt-in through the use of an HTTP/3
setting; this avoids potential protocol confusion attacks by ensuring the
HTTP/3 server explicitly supports it.  It also requires the use of the Origin
header, providing the server with the ability to deny access to Web-based
clients that do not originate from a trusted origin.

Just like HTTP traffic going over HTTP/3, WebTransport pools traffic to
different origins within a single connection.  Different origins imply
different trust domains, meaning that the implementations have to treat each
transport as potentially hostile towards others on the same connection.  One
potential attack is a resource exhaustion attack: since all of the transports
share both congestion control and flow control context, a single client
aggressively using up those resources can cause other transports to stall.  The
user agent thus SHOULD implement a fairness scheme that ensures that each
transport within connection gets a reasonable share of controlled resources;
this applies both to sending data and to opening new streams.

A client could attempt to exhaust resources by opening too many WebTransport
sessions at once.  In cases when the client is untrusted, the user agent SHOULD
limit the number of outgoing sessions the client can open.
